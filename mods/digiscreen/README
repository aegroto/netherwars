Images consist of tables, containing one table for each row with keys numbered from 1 to 16.
Within each row are 16 strings, one for each pixel in the row, with keys numbered from 1 to 16.
Each string contains the color for that pixel as a 6-digit hex color, with optional "#" prefix.
Invalid or omitted pixels or rows will appear as black, and excess pixels or rows will be discarded.
