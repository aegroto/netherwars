Dispenser
---------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Contains an inventory and dispenses (with velocity) an item on command.
Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will take
items from the top and sides, and release them from the bottom. Pipeworks
tubes can push items into and pull items from the inventory.

To spawn entities from dispensers include the lwcomponents_spawners mod.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

Digilines messages

"dispense"
	Dispenses the next item. No dispense if dispenser is empty.

"dispense <slot>"
	Dispenses 1 item from the given slot (1 to 16). No dispense if slot is
	empty.
	eg. "dispense 7"

"dispense <itemname>"
	Dispenses 1 item of the given name. No dispense if dispenser does not
	contain the item.
	eg. "dispense default:stone"

When an item is dropped a digilines message is sent with the dropper's
channel. The message is a table with the following keys:
{
	action = "dispense",
	name = "<itemname>", -- name of dropped item
	slot = <slot> -- slot number the item was taken from (1 to 16).
}
