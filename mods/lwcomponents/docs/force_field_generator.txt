Force Field Generator
---------------------

Force field generators repel players and mobs within a given radius from
the generator. The radius can be 5 to 25 and is in all directions. An
'electric dome' appears marking the field. The generator consumes fuel
relative to the radius. A radius of 25 uses 1 coal in 10 seconds, 5 uses
1 coal in 50 seconds. Each time an entity is repelled it cost 1 fuel value
(1/40 of a coal). Any players or mobs permitted inside the field can be
added to the Permit list. Each entry must be on a new line with no extra
spaces. Empty lines (not even a space) are ignored. The mob's registered
name or tag can be used. The owner of a locked generator will not be
repelled. When something is repelled it takes a small amount of damage.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

Digilines messages

"start"
	Start the generator.

"stop"
	Stop the generator.

"radius n"
	Set the radius to n, where n is a number between 5 to 25.

"add <name>"
	Add a name to the permit list.

"remove <name>"
	Remove a name from the permit list.

"status"
	Query the status of the generator. The generator will send a digilines
	message with its own channel as the following table:
	{
		action = "status",
		state = "on" | "off",
		radius = n, -- radius as number
		permit =
		{
			<list of names>
		},
		fuel =
		{
			name = name, -- eg. "default:coal_lump", will be "" if empty
			count = n, -- count of fuel
		}
	}


Hoppers and pipeworks tubes can be used to push or pull the fuel.
