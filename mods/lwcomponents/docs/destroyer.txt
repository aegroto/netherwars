Destroyer
---------

Destroyers dispose of items placed in their single slot inventory (basically
a trash). Items can be push into destroyers with tubes from pipeworks or
hoppers attached to the top or sides, so they are suitable for automation.
Items cannot be pulled out of destroyers.

Note that destroyers act when an item is placed in their inventory, as with
storage indexers it is best to use the hopper from this mod to feed them
in multi-player games.
