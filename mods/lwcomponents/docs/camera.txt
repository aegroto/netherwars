Camera
------
* This block is only available if digilines is loaded.

Cameras take an image in the direction they are facing. The colors in the
image represent what is being viewed. Nodes are gray, entities are blue and
players are green. The closer they are to the camera the brighter the color.
The viewing distance of the camera is 1 to 16 nodes. Also acts as a
digilines conductor.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

UI

Channel - digilines channel of camera.
Distance - the viewing distance forward from the camera (1 to 16).
Resolution - the image resolution (for both width and height, 1 to 128).

Digilines messages

"scan"
	Sends a digilines message with the camera's channel and a table of the
	image as the message (see below).

"distance n"
	Sets the viewing distance of the camera. Will be clipped between 1 and
	16.

"resolution n"
	Sets the image resolution of the camera.

The image is an indexed table of indexed tables. Each inner table is one
line of the image ordered top to bottom. There are resolution number of
lines. Each line has a string value for each pixel of that line left to
right. The string is a hex color string eg. "00FF00". There are resolution
number of pixels per line.

The image format is compatible with digistuff's digiscreens and lwcomputers'
digiscreens and digipanels. It is best to set the resolution of the camera
to the resolution of the display, then the image from the camera can be sent
straight to the display device.
