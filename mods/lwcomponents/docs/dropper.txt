Dropper
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Contains an inventory and drops item/s on command. Also acts as a
digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will take items from the
top and sides, and release them from the bottom. Pipeworks tubes can push
items into and pull items from the inventory.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

Digilines messages

"drop [<slot>|<itemname>] [qty]"
	slot or itemname are optional. If given slot must be the number of
	the dropper slot to drop from (1 to 16). itemname must be the name of
	the item from the dropper to drop (eg. default:stone).
	qty is optional. If given must be the number of items to drop. If
	omitted the quantity set on the dropper's form is dropped.

examples:
"drop"
	Drops the first found item with the quantity from the dropper's form.

"drop 7"
	Drops items from slot 7 with the quantity from the dropper's form.

"drop default:stone"
	Drops the item "default:stone" with the quantity from the dropper's form.

"drop 7 5"
	Drops items from slot 7 with the quantity of 5.

"drop default:stone 5"
	Drops the item "default:stone" with the quantity of 5.

"drop nil 5"
	Drops the first found item with the quantity of 5.

If there are not enough items in the dropper (of a name or in a slot) to
fulfil the quantity, only the amount available is dropped. If no slot or
name is given the first found item is used (multiple items are not dropped
to fulfil the quantity).


When items are dropped a digilines message is sent with the dropper's
channel. The message is a table with the following keys:
{
	action = "drop",
	name = "<itemname>", -- name of dropped item/s
	slot = <slot>, -- slot number the item/s were taken from (1 to 16). If
						-- more than one slot was taken from this will be -1
	qty = <number> -- the number of items dropped
}
