Collector
---------
* This block is only available if digilines is loaded.

Picks up dropped items in adjacent block, with optional filtering. Also
acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will take items
from the top and sides, and release them from the bottom. Pipeworks tubes
can push items into and pull items from the inventory.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

	count = <count> -- number of the item picked up.
}
