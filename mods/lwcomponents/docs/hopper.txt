Hopper
------
* This block is only available if the hopper mod is loaded.

This version of a hopper will transfer items from a drop or inventory in
the node at the wide end of the hopper to the inventory in the node at the
narrow end of the hopper. The hopper has no inventory itself, and always
moves items one at a time, every second. These hoppers cannot be chained
to transfer items, but work in unloaded blocks. This hopper uses the
hopper mod's registered list of nodes, and should work with nodes with
hopper support. These hoppers can be rotated with a screwdriver, but
function as their typical placement when rotated.
