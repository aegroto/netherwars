Digilines Switch
----------------
* This block is only available if both digilines and mesecons are loaded.

Digilines switches act as both a digilines message target and a digilines
cable, as well as a mesecons power source. They can be placed beside each
other to form a bank, horizontally or vertically.

Right click the digilines switch to give it a channel.

Mesecon power can be delivered at 6 sides of the digilines switch, the
adjacent 4 in the (x, z), above and below. Around the connector on these
sides are a colored border indicating the side. The sides are named "red",
"green", "blue", "yellow", "white" and "black".

The digilines message sent to the digilines switch dictates the action,
"on" or "off". The action can be followed with the side to act upon,
separated by a space. eg. "on white". If a side is stated only that side
is acted upon. If the side is omitted (or is invalid) all 6 sides are
acted upon. If the side name "switch" is given the power is supplied the
same as a mesecons switch (all horizontal sides, one below, this height
and one above).

A note on connecting mesecons wires. Mesecons does not appear to allow
for some sides to be on and some off on receptors (power sources). When
any side is on the state of the digilines switch is on, but only rules for
the powered sides are defined. This means if wires are placed while in
this state only the sides that are powered will connect. When no side is
powered the state of the digilines switch is off with rules defined for
all potentially connected sides. In this state (as when first placed)
mesecons wires will connect correctly.
