Breaker
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Breakers dig the node up to 5 nodes directly in front of them and drop
the item at the back of them, or into a pipeworks tube if one is placed
behind it. The node is only dug if the breaker has a tool that can dig it
or if it can be dug by hand, and there are no nodes before of it. ie.
cannot dig 2nd node if 1st node has something in it. The tool is worn if
used. Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded,
will take tools from the top and sides. Pipeworks tubes can push items
into and pull items from the inventory.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version. To break
nodes in a protected area, the locked version must be used and the owner
must be able to dig in the area.
